#Using the iris data frame (this is built in to R), create a new variable that categorizes petal length into three groups:
#small (less than or equal to the 1st quartile)
#medium (between the 1st and 3rd quartiles)
#large (greater than or equal to the 3rd quartile)
#Hint: Explore the iris data using summary(iris$Petal.Length), to see the petal length distribution. Then use your function of choice: ifelse() or case_when() to make a new variable named petal.length.cat based on the conditions listed above. Note that in the iris data frame there are no NAs, so we donâ€™t have to deal with them here

summary(iris$Petal.Length)
iris %>% 
  mutate(petal.length.cat = case_when(
    Petal.Length <= 1.6 ~ "small",
    Petal.Length > 1.6 & Petal.Length < 5.1 ~ "medium",
    Petal.Length >=5.1 ~ "big"
  ))

#Filter the data so that only species_id = NL,and call this surveysNL
#Join the tail data to the surveysNL data (i.e. left join with surveysNL on the left). Name it surveysNL_tail_left. How many rows are there?

surveys <- read_csv('data/portal_data_joined.csv')
surveysNL <- filter(surveys, species_id == "NL")
nrow(surveysNL)
#1252 rows 

#Join the surveysNL data to the tail data (i.e. right join with surveysNL on the left). Name it surveysNL_tail_right. How many rows are there?

tail_surveysNL_left <- left_join(x=tail, y=surveysNL, by = 'record_id')
nrow(surveysNL_tail_right)
